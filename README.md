*This program can be ran on any PC, as long as all of the files remain in the same folder*

  This program initilazes with the Wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_Language and scrapes the words
into a custom HashSet with a cache for each page scraped from the wiki site. Then the user can enter a URl to any webpage and
a cosine similarity will be done to recommend the top 5 wikipedia pages to the user!
